# gorter

A URL ~~shortener~~enhancer written Go. Probably the 18 billionth one, but tonight I decided to write some Golang out of nowhere and figured this is a simple (and bandwagonny) place to start. Added some RESTful API consumption and `math/rand` fiddling to make it more unique and fun for myself. Still, nothing more than a quut little side project to learn some Go. Honestly, love it so far. Will be back for more.

## dev TODOs

* Prettify the UI (but not too much)
