# gorter

A URL shortener written Go. Probably the 18 billionth one, but tonight I decided to write some Golang out of nowhere and figured this is a simple (and bandwagonny) place to start.

## dev TODOs

* Get the UI to a functional state as a url shortener)
* Prettify the UI (but not too much)
* Introduce the actual main functionality of the product, i.e. the "enhancing"
    * Either reference DB for this or static file. Or an existing API if one exists, though that's probably less future-proof unless it's my own. Any of the above will work. Will probably opt for some DB solution since it's not going to be a big enough dataset that remote storage would cost anything
